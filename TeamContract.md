# Team Contract

## Preparation
* Each team member studies and completes the assigned materials and completes individual readiness work before class.
* Each member ensures the fulfillment of the shared outcome. Our focus is on mastering the skillset and norms to communicate and contribute towards the group project effectively.
* Members who come unprepared and do not contribute effectively will be accounted for in the peer evaluation.

---

## Communication
* We will use Instagram and Discord as communication channels for the teamwork. Instagram for short notifications, Discord for long-form communications.
* Each team member commits to responding within 12 hours on weekdays.
* All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive.
* Each team member commits to following the discourse in the communication channel and keeping track of the development.
* Facing problems in work or understanding material, the member commits to asking for help either from other members of the team or the instructor team.
* Poor communication and lack of effort will be reflected in peer evaluations.

---

## Attendance and Participation
* Each member will attend all scheduled classes, tutorials, and, importantly, the scheduled team meetings, unless illness or emergencies occur.
* Each member must arrive punctually to meetings and be prepared to contribute immediately.
* Coursework, i.e. deliverables in other courses, is not a reason for not attending scheduled meetings. Each member indicates their availability during scheduling for team meetings.
* If unable to attend, the member must notify the team in advance and provide input or complete tasks asynchronously. The member communicates their progress in the designated channels.
* During team activities, every member will engage and contribute ideas.
* Repeated absences without notice and lack of commitment will be reflected in peer evaluations and reported to the instructor team if persistent.
* Each member commits to keeping track of the changes in the project through GitHub.

## Decision Making
* Members will make decisions based on consensus and mutual agreement when possible.
* Decisions need to be thoroughly discussed and, when necessary, debated.
* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken, majority rules.
* If new information emerges that invalidates a prior decision, the team may reopen the discussion with majority agreement. Revision is encouraged.
* Decisions should be summarized in a shared log in GitHub that tracks plans and development.

## Work Quality
* All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.
* All deliverables adhere to the course standard, i.e., clean architecture, code modularity.
* All code must be thoroughly tested and must include unit tests where applicable.
* All modifications, discounting a few exceptions and emergencies, must be done on a personal branch and merged through a pull request.
* Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.
* If necessary, designated code reviewers will be assigned.
* Commit messages and PR messages must be clear and reflect the changes made. Messages such as “asdf1234” and empty messages will not be accepted. The member who submits an insufficient message will promptly make a new commit/pull request.
* Code reviews should focus on correctness, clarity, and maintainability, and adherence to the course standard, not personal style.
* Copying and pasting low-quality AI-generated code will not be accepted.
* The main branch must always pass all tests.

---

## Conflict resolution
* The team will first and foremost attempt to resolve any conflict through open discussion.
* Team members should raise issues early and focus on identifying the root cause, not assigning blame.
* All parties agree to listen actively and seek compromise where possible.
* If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the instructor team to mediate the problem.

---

## Accountability
* Each member commits to completing their share of the work in a timely manner.
* Each member commits to seeking help from the group or the instructor team if they are unable to complete their share of the work.
* Each member is accountable for the code they produce, i.e., whether they adhere to the standards set in the course or whether they pass the tests.
* Each member agrees to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.
* Each member commits to providing and accepting constructive feedback to and from each other throughout the project work.
